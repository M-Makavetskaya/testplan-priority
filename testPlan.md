##Identifying the testing scope, and determining test cases.

Step 1: Request requirements from the stakeholders(BA, PO and others) for the payment gateway integration. Investigate the current payment system of the e-commerce platform.

Step 2: Conduct documentation and requirements testing. Identify if the new third-party payment gateway fits the current functionality. Identify priorities, risks, and gaps.

Step 3: Create test cases/ test scenarios/ checklists. Include checks of configurations, positive and negative cases(transactions), post-transaction functionality checks, security checks, user experience testing

Step 5: Create traceability matrix

During this process collaborate with stakeholders and the test team to confirm the scope of testing and priorities. Align and adjust the results accordingly to feedback and with project objectives and needs.


##Handling Changes in Requirements During Testing

Step 1: Agreed with stakeholders about the process of requirement changes: How the test team will be notified about requirements?

Step 2: Analyze CR. Review and update existing test scenarios, and create new ones.

Step 3: Agreed with stakeholders about changes in the timeline if needed.

Step 4: Test CR, perform regression testing.
