## Prioritization

###Step 1:
During planning, clarify priority with stakeholders, and align testing activities with the project schedule(milestones, deadlines). Priories also can be adjusted according to customer feedback.

###Step 2:
If it is possible adjust automation tests in advance.

###Step 3:
Perform testing of the feature accordingly to priority.
run integration tests. Analyze results. Adjust tests if required. If some tests need more time to modification, it can be planned after the testing cycle(release);
perform functional testing of the feature;
run regression/ E2E tests.  If it is applicable run a smoke test to confirm that the build is functional. Analyze results. Adjust tests if required;
perform other types of testing (security, performance).

###Step 4:
Report results to stakeholders(manager), and notify them about found issues, blockers, and changes in timelines if it happened.


***Additional: In the case of CR.***
Confirm with stakeholders about new priorities for testing. Notify about risks and changes in the testing schedule, and about additional testing activities if required. Perform test accordingly new priorities.
